# To-do List
- If nothing is in queue, `/skip` should just stop the current song (probably just jump to `/stop`)
- Pause/resume system
- `/stop` shouldn't *necessarily* clear the queue, so it could be resumed
- Separate *"clear queue"* command
- `yt-dlp` update solution if not installed with package manager
